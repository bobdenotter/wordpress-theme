Bolt WP Theme
==============

A Bolt extension to use your Wordpress themes as-in in Bolt. Drop them in `/theme/`, and
activate them in your `config.yml`, and you're good to go.

This extension is still under development. It'll be ready for production around the same
time as Bolt 3.0 is. Which will be Q1 2016.
